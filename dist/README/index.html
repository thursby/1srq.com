It is not necessary to accept this invite if you wish<br>to use an<br><a href="https://www.netlify.com/docs/identity/#external-provider-login">OAuth provider</a><br>(e.g. Github) to manage authentication for your CMS.<br>It is recommended to use this method of authentication as it removes the need<br>for an email &amp; password to log in to the CMS and is generally more secure. You<br>will need to add an OAuth provider in your Netlify app settings under<br>&quot;Settings&quot; &gt; &quot;Identity&quot; &gt; &quot;External providers&quot;.</p><p>Once you've added an OAuth provider, navigate to <code>/admin</code> on your site, select your provider from the<br>list, and you should then be logged into your CMS. Cool huh?</p><p>Now you're all set, and you can start editing content!</p><h2 id="gotchas">Gotchas</h2><p>If you change the repo that was created at deploy time from public to private, you'll need to regenerate your token,<br>as the token generated using the deploy to Netlify button can only access public repositories. To<br>regenerate your token, head to &quot;Settings&quot; in your Netlify site dashboard, go to the &quot;Identity&quot;<br>section, then scroll to &quot;Services&quot; where you'll see an &quot;Edit settings&quot; button. Click that and you'll<br>see a text link to &quot;Generate access token in GitHub&quot;.</p><p>If you need any help with setting up Netlify CMS, you can reach out to the Netlify team in the <a href="https://gitter.im/netlify/netlifycms">Netlify CMS Gitter</a>.</p><h2 id="local-development">Local development</h2><h3 id="1.-clone-this-repository%3A">1.
